        <h2 class="head_title">Welcome to Quantum Random Number Generation and Stimulation </h2>
        <span class="head_desc">
        Random number generation is something we have been doing for a long time, sometimes for making a game or a stimulation or anything. 
        But the core idea of generating truly random numbers on a classical computer is a myth. 
        Any number generated on a classical computer is based on an algorithm with a randomly generated seed value, that is called a pseudorandom number. 
        The problem with a pseudorandom number is that, the seed value and the sequence start repeating after it passes its period. 
        This paper presents a quantum circuit algorithm that can generate true random ASCII characters. 
        This algorithm takes advantage of the quantum superposition and uncertainty in the spin of an electron to get the quantum bit state in either 0 or 1.
